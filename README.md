# Twilio OTP Authentication with Node.js

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and implementation details for integrating Twilio OTP (One-Time Password) authentication in a Node.js application. Twilio is a powerful cloud communication platform that allows you to send SMS, WhatsApp messages, emails, and more, making it an excellent choice for implementing OTP-based authentication.


## Twilio OTP Authentication Workflow

The OTP authentication process involves sending a verification code via SMS to a user and verifying the entered code using Twilio services. The workflow is as follows:

1. **Send OTP**: Our application sends an API request to Twilio, instructing it to send a verification code to the user's phone number via SMS.

2. **Verify OTP**: After the user enters the code in our application, another API request is sent to Twilio to verify whether the entered code is correct.

## Twilio Account & Verify Service Setup

To set up Twilio for OTP authentication, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Account on Twilio**: Sign up for a Twilio account.

2. **Choose Twilio Product and Plan**: Select "SMS" as the Twilio product and "Identity and Verification" as the plan.

3. **Create Twilio Account SID and Auth Token**: Each Twilio account is identified by an "Account SID" and "Auth Token."

4. **Add "Verify" Product to the "Develop" Section**: Ensure that the "Verify" product is added to the "Develop" section.

5. **Create a Verify Service**: Set up a custom service name and choose "SMS" as the verification channel. Note the "Service SID."

## Node.js Implementation

Follow these steps to implement Twilio OTP authentication in your Node.js application:

1. **Initialize Your Project**: Create a `package.json` file and install the required dependencies, including the Twilio library.

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    npm install twilio express body-parser dotenv
    ```

2. **Set Up Twilio Credentials**: Create a `.env` file and add your Twilio credentials.

    ```env
    PORT="Your Port"
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="Your Twilio Account SID"
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="Your Twilio Auth Token"
    TWILIO_SERVICE_SID="Your Twilio Service SID"
    ```

3. **Create Entry File and Router**: Set up the entry file (`index.js`) and a router file (`src/routes/`) to handle Twilio OTP operations.


## Usage

To use this implementation in your Node.js application, clone this repository and follow the steps mentioned in the article. Ensure that you have a Twilio account and have set up the required credentials.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikkisingh0204/twilio-otp-service.git
cd back-end
npm install
npm start
```

Feel free to customize the code and adapt it to your specific use case.
